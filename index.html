    <h1>Destiny 2</h1>
    <p><a href = "https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/newlight" title = "Destiny 2 Homepage" target = "_blank">Destiny 2</a> is a fun game that has great <strong>core</strong> gameplay, but an increasingly <strong>stale</strong> gameplay loop. As a long-time player, it is <strong>difficult</strong> to watch it go through the troubles and issues
      that it is currently facing. Hopefully, the developers are able to <strong>fix</strong> these issues and pull the game back up to being something that is <strong>incredibly</strong> engaging. Next year will be the
      end of their 10-year saga for the game, and hopefully it finishes <strong>strong.</strong>
